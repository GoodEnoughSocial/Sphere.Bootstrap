# Sphere.Bootstrap

This contains some scripts that hopefully make working on this project a little easier.

## Windows example instructions

```
mkdir c:\sphere\
cd c:\sphere\
git clone git@github.com:GoodEnoughSocial/Sphere.Bootstrap.git
cd c:\sphere\Sphere.Bootstrap\
c:\sphere\Sphere.Bootstrap\bootstrap.bat
```

`c:\sphere` should now contain every relevant repository.

`c:\sphere` will also contain `c:\sphere\pullall.bat` which when ran will traverse every repository and perform a `git pull` to pull newest changes.

If desired, `c:\sphere\sphere.sln` also exists, which loads up a sln with all projects already added to it.

## Linux example instructions

Nothing yet, sorry - see https://github.com/GoodEnoughSocial/Sphere.Bootstrap/issues/2
